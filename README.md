Evaluation of Munich Airbnb data

# 1. Installations
  import numpy as np # linear algebra
  import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
  %matplotlib inline # magic word for producing visualizations in notebook
  import pandas_profiling # import pandas profiling  
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # import libraries for linear regression
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  from sklearn import metrics  
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # import standard scaler
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA # import PCA

# 2. Project Motivation
  The main purpose of this data science project on Airbnb Data of Munich, Germany is educational. This blog post and analysis was done as a project within the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The CRISP-DM process model is applied in practice. As part of this analysis several data science methods (e.g. supervised learning, pca) are applied
  Since the author is currently a resident of Munich, there is also a private interest in understanding how Airbnb in Munich works.
  
# 3. File Descriptions

# 4. How to Interact with your project
  Since the main purpose of this analysis is educational, I would really appreciate any feedback on possible improvements in code, modeling and general problem-solving approach. Otherwise it would be may pleasure if my files could serve as orientation or base for other projects. The projects results are the following:
* Appropriate price for a listing (chapter 3): even though a suitable model for the determination could not established in this analysis, the descriptive statistics provide a reference for the current price ranges.Â 
* Influence of listing properties on price (chapter 4): Room type and neighbourhood appear to have a high effect on listing prices. However an in detail analysis of more features is required in order to derive any suitable model for prediction.
* Oktoberfest effect on Airbnb prices (chapter 5): also here a suitable model could not be established, analysis of more data is required. Again descriptive statistics illustrates that there is a significant change in prices during the Oktoberfest for some features, but crucially not in all listings.
